Daryl Dixon is a character from **The Walking Dead**. He quickly goes from being the *threat* of his group to the most *trustworthy and loyal* ally. The evolvement of this character has swept all viewers off their feet, becoming *arguably* the most **important** character. Especially when some main characters of the show start *losing* their morals and/or humanity. He is symbolic of **loyalty**, **trust**, **compassion**, and **voice of reason**. 

Top 3 Best Things:
* Loyal to his group. 
* Main weapon is his cross bow.
* Always wears a leather vest with angel wings.
